    <h1>20years of life and 20 years of different expriences</h1>
    <p>This year I've completed 20 years of my life. It is very exciting to go through different phases and meet with different faces.
        It has helped me to in many ways to deal with every situation and problems pateintly and calmly.</p>
        <big>
            Here, are some of my experiences in School:

        <p><pre style="text-align: left;">
            ~ Debate Competition: In the first year of my college, a debate
             competition was organised for encouraging students to face their
              stage fear and also, so their debating skills. <br>

            ~ Fancy Dress Competition: In second semseter of my college, an event
             called <b>SHRISHTI</b> was held to motivate students for regularly
             attend class as curriculum and aceadmics both are equally important.
             In fancy dress competition, I was dressed up as <i>Anjali</i> from the
             movie <b>KUCH KUCH HOTA HAI</b>, and my partner was <i>Rahul</i> from
             the same movie. We have performed a scene from the movie.
